# ðŸ§  Thinking in React â€“ Parts I & II

This exercise is split into two main parts based on the "Thinking in React" approach:

## Part I: Component Structure and State Lifting

- Created a ToDo List app using React functional components
- Lifted state up to manage todos and filter
- Passed props to child components (`AddToDo`, `FilterComponent`, `ToDoList`)

## Part II: Context API & Additional Challenges

- Refactored app to use the React Context API instead of prop drilling
- Implemented a filter to show all, active, or completed todos
- Integrated `localStorage` to persist todos
- Applied conditional styling: line-through on completed todos
